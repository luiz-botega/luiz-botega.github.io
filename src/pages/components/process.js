            For me, <span>Service Design</span> is about developing experiences
            from humans to humans. Transcending technocentric and user-only
            perspectives, service design deals with{" "}
            <span>humans and beyond</span>, thinking how our solutions will
            interact and impact the lives of users, customers, service staff,
            other stakeholders, the society around them and even the
            environment. Seeing solutions as service imply in a{" "}
            <span>holistic</span> view of the design process and its
            interdisciplinary participants. Out perspective should be systemic
            and we have to embrace embiguity along the way, since every decision
            has multiple consequences, and the holistic service viewpoint is
            helpfull to manage such trade-offs. Design is fundamentally{" "}
            <span>contextual</span>, since every development is multifaceted and
            unique. It requires the mediation of different tools for distinct
            teams and objectives, constantly adapting the framework along the
            way.

          <div className="col-6">
            This means that, in a service perspective, the{" "}
            <span>co-evolution</span> of problem and solution is key: we first
            need to identify the right problem and then seek the right solution.
            But while developing this solution our target problem is bound to
            change, gain new perspectives and nuances that will imply in new
            interpretations to our ever evolving solution. These solutions
            derive from and unfold in human <span>experiences</span>, from
            initial exploratory experience of developing the solution to the
            final experience of using it, and with that retro-feeding the
            process. Lastly, Service Design is a <span>sequential process</span>{" "}
            and has two dimensions. One is external, helping teams to deliver
            value from end-to-end to all humans and beyond, while the other is
            internal, helping development teams transversally and ensuring
            culture and practices of service design. We service designers, as
            mediators, have to trust our skills, insights and the process
            itself, because the Service Design process has in its core{" "}
            <span>making the world a better place for all</span>.
