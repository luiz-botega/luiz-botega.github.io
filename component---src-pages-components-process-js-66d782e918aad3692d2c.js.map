Seeing solutions as service imply in a{\" \"}\n            <span>holistic</span> view of the design process and its\n            interdisciplinary participants. Out perspective should be systemic\n            and we have to embrace embiguity along the way, since every decision\n            has multiple consequences, and the holistic service viewpoint is\n            helpfull to manage such trade-offs. Design is fundamentally{\" \"}\n            <span>contextual</span>, since every development is multifaceted and\n            unique. It requires the mediation of different tools for distinct\n            teams and objectives, constantly adapting the framework along the\n            way.\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-6\">\n            This means that, in a service perspective, the{\" \"}\n            <span>co-evolution</span> of problem and solution is key: we first\n            need to identify the right problem and then seek the right solution.\n            But while developing this solution our target problem is bound to\n            change, gain new perspectives and nuances that will imply in new\n            interpretations to our ever evolving solution. These solutions\n            derive from and unfold in human <span>experiences</span>, from\n            initial exploratory experience of developing the solution to the\n            final experience of using it, and with that retro-feeding the\n            process. Lastly, Service Design is a <span>sequential process</span>{\" \"}\n            and has two dimensions. One is external, helping teams to deliver\n            value from end-to-end to all humans and beyond, while the other is\n            internal, helping development teams transversally and ensuring\n            culture and practices of service design. We service designers, as\n            mediators, have to trust our skills, insights and the process\n            itself, because the Service Design process has in its core{\" \"}\n            <span>making the world a better place for all</span>.\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"process\" className=\"col-10\">\n          <div id=\"img-div\" className=\"col-10 hidden\">\n            <img src={processCycle} id=\"process-img\" />\n          </div>\n          <div id=\"process-spaces\" className=\"col-12\">\n            <div id=\"problem-space\" className=\"col-12 hidden\">\n              <div className=\"process-title\">Problem Space</div>\n              <div className=\"process-body\">\n                In this space the team focus on iteratively maturing problems\n                into an concise and clear opportuniry statement.
